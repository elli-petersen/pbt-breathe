# Breathe v1.0.5
*Breathe* is a gray and pine green theme built for the free forum software [ProBoards](https://proboards.com/). It features a fancy sticky navigation menu, affiliate bar, and remodels for all major layout templates. It’s intended for use with any forum genre or topic. Built using my v5 theme base, [*cast*](https://github.com/elli-petersen/pbt-cast).

As a premade, *Breathe* is to be installed to your forum as is, or customized to suit your specific needs. You may edit any part of this skin as long as my credits remain **intact** and **visible**. It may not be used as a base for your own premade, claimed as your own, or picked apart for specific code. If you are interested in an individual remodel, please request it.

Be sure to review the [Readme PDF](breathe-theme-readme.pdf) for the installation guide and additional information. Please reference this document before creating issues or posting for Support! It may already be answered.

With ProBoards v6 announced, there was no point in making this theme responsive, thus *Breathe* only supports 1366x768 resolutions and up.

If you’re less familiar with ProBoards themes or CSS/HTML, I would suggest reviewing these resources before getting started.
