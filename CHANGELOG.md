### v1.0.5
- Corrected issue from base theme where clicking pagination links causes the Font Awesome glyphs to disappear

### v1.0.4
- Added max-height: 170px to .scroll-content (info dropdown)
- Added comments around copyright to remind users not to remove it

### v1.0.3
- Made some adjustments to the Flexbox-built info dropdown so that images in the fourth column won't be cut off
- On that same vein, removed max-width: 25% from grid-col-4 as it was preventing the other columns from flowing around the image column, which has a pixel value width

### v1.0.2
- Fixed some table weirdness for the thread/conversation layouts that was causing the micro pagination to wrap
- Added ellipses overflow to contain long text in the mini profile fields and micro profiles
